        <h2>Prepositions</h2>
        <p>Well, hate to break it to you, but you're fucked now, just like the rest of us.</p>
        <p>
          Prepositions don't make any sense in any language. The best thing to do is to just accept your fate and fall
          back onto rote memorization. I will say that <i>på</i> is used quite often, so you can just take a cue from
          this poor attempt at personal memery.

          Joking aside, I intend for this page to contain as much information as I can gather about prepositions and
          their usage.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Expressions of Time</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most common illogical uses of prepositions is in expressions that denote when or for how long
            something occurs.
          </p>
          <p>For expressing the duration of an action, the preposition to use is generally <i>i</i>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jeg har lært norsk i nesten tre år: I have been learning Norwegian for almost three years.</li>
            <li>Jeg spilte fløyte i to år: I played flute for two years.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But, if we're saying how long we have <em>not</em> done something, then we need to use <i>på</i>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jeg har <em>ikke</em> sett henne på årevis: I have <em>not</em> seen her in years.</li>
            <li>Jeg har <em>ikke</em> spist noe på ti timer: I have<em>n't</em> eaten anything in ten hours.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also need to use <i>på</i> when talking about the total amount of time something takes to achieve a goal.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jeg kan vinne spillet på to timer: I can beat the game in two hours.</li>
            <li>Jeg lagde pizzaen på tretti minutter: I made the pizza in thirty minutes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And, we use <i>på</i> again when talking about days of the week.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vi møtes på mandag: We're meeting up on Monday.</li>
            <li>På søndager drikker jeg øl: On Sundays, I drink beer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But, we use <i>i</i> when talking about months.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vi møtes i mars: We're meeting up in March.</li>
            <li>I juli drikker jeg øl: In July, I drink beer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Then we have situations where we talk about points in time relative to the current time using durations:
            <i>om</i> for the future and <i>for ... siden</i> for the past.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vi møtes om to timer: We're meeting up in two hours (from now).</li>
            <li>Vi møttes for to timer siden: We met up two hours ago.</li>
          </ul>
