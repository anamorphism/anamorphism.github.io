        <h2>Prepositions</h2>
        <p>Well, hate to break it to you, but you're fucked now, just like the rest of us.</p>
        <p>
          Prepositions don't make any sense in any language. The best thing to do is to just accept your fate and fall
          back onto rote memorization. I will say that <i>p√•</i> is used quite often, so you can just take a cue from
          this poor attempt at personal memery.

          Joking aside, I intend for this page to contain as much information as I can gather about prepositions and
          their usage.
