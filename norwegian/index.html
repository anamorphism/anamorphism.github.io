        <h2>What is Norwegian anyway?</h2>
        <p>
          Fun fact, there are two official written languages and neither of them is really spoken. There's also no
          official spoken language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The official English names of the two written languages are Norwegian Bokmål and Norwegian Nynorsk. There's a
          lot of interesting history behind all of this, but let's just mention that Bokmål is the more widely used and
          the one most learning material available in English is for.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to pronunciation, you'll most likely be taught what is commonly referred to as Urban East
          Norwegian. It's a sociolect somewhat similar to British English's Received Pronunciation. But, even this is
          going to differ slightly in spoken use when compared to the way people will actually write in Bokmål.
