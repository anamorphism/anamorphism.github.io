        <h2>Grammatical Gender</h2>
        <p>
          Like many languages, Norwegian has the concept of grammatical gender. Each noun belongs to one of three
          grammatical genders: masculine, feminine or neuter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to remember that these really have nothing to do with biological gender. It might help knowing
          that the word <i>gender</i> comes from the same roots as <i>genus</i> and <i>genre</i>. That is to say that
          the word really just means a group or classification.
        </p>
        <p>A simple example of this is the word for <i>mom</i>: (en) mamma. This is a masculine word in Bokmål.</p>
        <p>
          It's generally recommended to learn all nouns with their indefinite articles. Don't just remember
          <i>mamma</i> (mom), but remember <i>en mamma</i> (a mom) instead.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Masculine (en): en ball, a ball</li>
          <li>Feminine (ei): ei and, a duck</li>
          <li>Neuter (et): et hus, a house</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The gender of a word factors into many things, so it's important that you learn it.

          <h3>Common Gender</h3>
          <p>
            To make things even more confusing, expressing all feminine words in common gender (masculine) forms is
            allowed in Bokmål. So, you can say both <i>ei and</i> and <i>en and</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't an all or nothing thing either. Certain dialects will prefer to express certain feminine nouns
            in common gender and others in feminine forms. Additionally, using the common gender indefinite article
            <i>en</i> is fairly common even if the word is expressed in feminine definite form. So, you may see
            <i>en and</i> but <i>anda</i> (the duck) rather than <i>anden</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My personal recommendation is to learn and use feminine forms for all feminine words until you find
            yourself living in a particular area of Norway. Then you can adopt local use as you are exposed to it.
