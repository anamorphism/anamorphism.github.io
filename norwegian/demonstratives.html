        <h2>Demonstratives</h2>
        <p>Demonstratives are the words <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>these</i> and <i>those</i> in English.</p>
        <p>
          Some languages have them, others don't. (Un)fortunately for us, Norwegian does. Why this might be considered
          unfortunate will hopefully become apparent later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonstratives in Bokmål are <i>dette</i>, <i>denne</i>, <i>det</i>, <i>den</i>, <i>disse</i> and
          <i>de</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use these words in two ways in both languages: as determiners and as pronouns.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Determiners</h3>
          <p>
            A determiner is a word that helps us determine (see what I did there?) which object or objects we are
            specifically talking about out of all objects of the same type.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we say "ball" we could be referring to any ball, but if we say "this ball" or "that ball" then it
            becomes clearer as to which ball we're talking about.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demonstrative determiners pretty much work the same way grammatically in both English and Norwegian.
            They are the first words in a noun phrase, that is to say any attributive adjectives will come after the
            determiner and before the noun itself. They must also match count of the noun in both languages:
            <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>dette</i>, <i>denne</i>, <i>det</i> and <i>den</i> for singular; and
            <i>these</i>, <i>those</i>, <i>disse</i> and <i>de</i> for plural.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only real difference is that you also need to worry about grammatical gender in Norwegian in the case
            of singular nouns: <i>dette</i> and <i>det</i> for neuter, and <i>denne</i> and <i>den</i> for masculine
            and feminine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing to mention is that noun phrases starting with demonstrative determiners are definite. We can
            think of it as though we're defining which specific thing or things we're talking about. In English, this
            isn't such a big deal since we don't decline words based on definiteness, but in Norwegian we do. So, just
            make sure to remember to put any attributive adjectives and the noun itself in definite form.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>dette huset: this house</li>
            <li>dette røde huset: this red house</li>
            <li>det huset: that house</li>
            <li>det røde huset: that red house</li>
            <li>denne ballen: this ball</li>
            <li>den ballen: that ball</li>
            <li>denne anda: this duck</li>
            <li>den anda: that duck</li>
            <li>disse hus[ene|a]/ballene/endene: these houses/balls/ducks</li>
            <li>de hus[ene|a]/ballene/endene: those houses/balls/ducks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>"But, Damien, doesn't <i>det røde huset</i> mean <i>the red house</i>?"</p>
          <p>
            It sure does. We can either rely on context to make things clear or add additional words like <i>der</i> to
            really drive the point home.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>det røde huset der: that red house / the red house there</li>
            <li>den lille jenta der: that little girl / the little girl there</li>
            <li>de store ballene der: those big balls / the big balls there</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Pronouns</h3>
          <p>
            This is where things get a bit unfortunate for those of us that are native English speakers or know English
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, Norwegian actually pays attention to whether nouns have been introduced into the context of the
            conversation or text. The bit that trips up us English speakers is that we need to remember to use the
            singular neuter form of the demonstrative pronoun in all situations where the noun hasn't been introduced
            yet in Norwegian.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Dette er de viktigste egenskapene for ledere nå: These are the most important traits for leaders now.
            </li>
            <li>Det er egenskapene jeg liker: Those are the traits I like.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even though the pronoun represents a masculine word (en egenskap) in this sentence, and even though we're
            referring to a plural use of that noun, we haven't introduced what we're talking about yet to the context at
            hand. Thus, we need to use <i>dette</i> or <i>det</i> respectively, the singular neuter form of the
            demonstrative. In English, we still match count and use <i>these</i> or <i>those</i> even though we don't
            know what we're talking about yet.
          </p>
          <p>Once the noun is in context, however, we switch to matching gender and count.</p>
          <p>
            It's a bit difficult to show examples of this, as we often switch from using a demonstrative pronoun to a
            more standard pronoun in subsequent sentences in both languages: <i>it</i> or <i>they</i> in English, and
            <i>den</i>, <i>det</i> or <i>de</i> in Bokmål. However, we may see something like the following.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Dette er alle knivene. Denne kniven er den billigste, men denne er skarpere: These are all the knives.
              This knife is the cheapest (one), but this (one) is the sharpest.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We know we're talking about knives by the time we get to the third demonstrative. It might help to think
            about it as just not wanting to repeat the word <i>knife</i> or <i>kniven</i> over and over again. We often
            insert a <i>one</i> in English in these situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stepping back a bit ... it's also worth mentioning that the second example above could also be translated as
            "they are the traits I like." This same "singular neuter" rule applies when using <i>it</i> and <i>they</i>
            (<i>den</i>, <i>det</i> and <i>de</i>).
